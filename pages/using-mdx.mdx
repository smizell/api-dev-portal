# Using MDX for Documentation

MDX is a tool that lets you write React code directly in Markdown. This page is written in Markdown, but if needed, we can include React components and JavaScript directly in our Markdown.
Below is a `Counter` component that is defined within the Markdown and then called in the Markdown.

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button style={{padding: "4px"}} onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

<Counter />

This gives you the familiarity with Markdown with the power of JavaScript together.

## MDX Files

Once you set up MDX to run in your project, the only step needed to use MDX is to create a file with the extension `.mdx`. If you name a file `about.mdx`, you'll be able to access it from `https://example.com/about`.

You can [view this page](https://github.com/smizell/api-dev-portal/blob/main/pages/using-mdx.mdx) on GitHub to see the React component in use.
